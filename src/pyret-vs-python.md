## Pyret vs. Python {#pyret-vs-python}

For the curious, we offer a few examples here to justify our frustration with
Python for early programming.

```{=html}
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="TwoColumn"><tr><td><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Python</span></p></td><td><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Pyret</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Python exposes machine arithmetic by default. Thus, by default,
<span class="sourceCode" title="Python"><code class="sourceCode" data-lang="text/x-python">0.1 + 0.2</code></span> is not the same as <span class="sourceCode" title="Python"><code class="sourceCode" data-lang="text/x-python">0.3</code></span>. (We hope you’re
not surprised to hear this.) Why this is the case is a
fascinating subject of study, but we consistently find it a distraction for first-time programmers writing programs with arithmetic.
And if we handwave the details of floating point aside, are we
taking our claims of program reliability seriously?</p></td><td><p>Pyret implements exact arithmetic, including rationals, by default. In
Pyret, <span class="sourceCode" title="Pyret"><code class="sourceCode" data-lang="pyret">0.1 + 0.2</code></span> really is equal to <span class="sourceCode" title="Pyret"><code class="sourceCode" data-lang="pyret">0.3</code></span>. Where a computation must
return an inexact number, Pyret does it <span class="emph">explicitly</span>: a key requirement in
a curriculum built on reliability.</p></td></tr></table>

learning outcome, along with understanding variables’ scopes. Python explicitly
conflates declaration with update, and <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">has a tangled history with scope</a>.</p></td><td><p>Pyret is statically scoped, and goes to great lengths—<wbr/>e.g., in the
design of a query language for tables—<wbr/>to maintain it. There is no ambiguity in
Pyret’s syntax for working with variables.</p></td></tr></table>

annotation syntax supports refinements. However, these are checked dynamically, so that
students do not need to satisfy the vagaries of any particular proof assistant.</p></td></tr></table>

professional libraries to test software, these impose a non-trivial burden on
learners, as a result of which most introductory curricula do not use them.</p></td><td><p>First, a curriculum that proclaims reliability must put testing at its
heart. Second, our pedagogy places heavy emphasis on the use of examples, and
in particular the building-up of abstractions from concrete instances. For both
these reasons, Pyret has extensive support in the language itself—<wbr/>not
through optional, external libraries—<wbr/>for writing examples and tests, and
provides direct language support for many of the interesting and tricky issues
that arise when doing so.</p></td></tr></table>

property-based testing is a very useful
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wnk-use-rel-prob-pbt/">gateway</a>
to thinking about formal properties. In Python, this is only available through libraries.</p></td><td><p>Pyret has convenient language features—<wbr/>such as the use of

programming. Pyret nudges students to program without state while
still permitting the full range of stateful programming. This comes
with safeguards both linguistic (e.g., variables are immutable unless
declared otherwise) and in output (e.g., mutable fields are displayed
to alert the student that the value may change or may even have
already changed).</p></td></tr></table>

device. Therefore, Pyret has a carefully-designed family of equality
operators that are not only of practical value but also have pedagogic
use.</p></td></tr></table>

a number (and why not?). Images are <span class="emph">fun</span> values, but they aren’t

They can be especially intimidated by
error reports, and can feel discouraged about causing errors. Thus,
Pyret’s error messages are the result of nearly a
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice-sigcse/">decade</a>
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-mind-lang-novice-inter-error-msg/">of</a>
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wk-error-msg-classifier/">research</a>.

on the nature and presentation of information in Pyret’s errors.</p></td></tr></table>

For example, the result of <span class="stt">map</span> in Python is actually a special
generator value. This can lead to outcomes requiring extra explanation, like <span class="stt">map(str, [1, 2, 3])</span> producing <span class="stt">&lt;map object at 0x1045f4940&gt;</span>.
Type hints (discussed above) are another example.</p></td><td><p>Since Pyret’s target audience is novice programmers programming in the
style of this book, our primary goal when adding any feature is to preserve the
early experience and avoid surprises.</p></td></tr></table>

on built-in data structures (especially dictionaries) and makes user-defined
ones unwieldy to create.</p></td><td><p>Pyret borrows from the rich tradition of languages like Standard ML,
OCaml, and Haskell to provide algebraic datatypes, whose absence often forces
programmers to engage in unwieldy (and inefficient) encoding tricks.</p></td></tr></table>

undesirable outcomes. For instance, <span class="sourceCode" title="Python"><code class="sourceCode" data-lang="text/x-python">=</code></span> sometimes introduces new

return a value doesn’t result in an error but silently returns
